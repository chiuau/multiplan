# The Vehicle Formation Planning Algorithms
These are the source codes of the vehicle formation algorithms we described in the paper we submitted to ICRA 2023. We have implemented a brute-force search algorithm, an exact graph-search algorithm, and the dynamic programming algorithm as described in the paper. The codes of the algorithms can be found in formation_graph.h and formation_graph.cpp.
